This is my work on refactoring some simple template into a single page knowledge base for one financial organization. It fully covered the needs of employees, as it has the following functions:
1. Calculator % on simple js.
2. Automatic deletion of the desired text fragment.
3. Copying the issued text with the addition of a greeting and/or signature.
4. Ordered content with a quick transition to the desired fragment.
5. Settings that allow you to disable certain functions (changes are saved in the cache).
6. Feedback function, anyone can send wishes or suggest corrections through the form (the message will automatically be sent to Telegram via the bot).
7. The page may contain links to useful web resources used in work.
   While writing the code, I used the following libraries:
   anime.js v3.2.1 - animejs.com
   MoveTo - https://github.com/hsnaydd/moveTo
   Rellax.js - https://dixonandmoe.com/rellax/
   Snowy.js - https://snowyjs.lol/
   This is my first job, I'm just learning. The code may have bugs and may be difficult, but it works well. I do not claim that he looks the way I would like, maybe in the future I will be perfect.
   The text above was written with the help of a translator. ^_^
